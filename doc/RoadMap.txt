1. Rename the Disks Class to Volume and investigate whether you need it to be a class or namespace (Done. Made it as class)
2. Merge the Dispatcher with the manager (done)

2. Add 'release' and 'quire' functions

3. Modify Logger class to accept localhost_name, program_name in the constructor to avoid typing these everytime

4. Put the parse_args function in utilities

5. redo the configuration load to a better way to avoid writing it more than one time

6. Removing the syncing from inside the sync.cpp file and put it in a separate file

7. Move the syncing funtionality to Disks(Volumes Class)

8. fixed the disatcher pars_args function (done for dispatcher. Still needed for sync and client)

9. use dynamic array to avoid segment fault in manager, disk, dispatcher

10. When installing the machine on a new machine, make sure that the installer creates the direcotryes for TempMountPoint VolumeFilePath SnapshotFile *LogFile. All of these varibles etcist on the erc/config file.

11. make sure that the dispatcher and client program adds an entry in the /etc/fstab for the mounted disk

12. Create a sync class so it can be used by dispatcher and synchroziner and Volumes class

13. have snapshots class to use unix time rather than actual time. Also, store data in unix time

14. mount/ensure the target file system 

15. start a cleaner thread that check if volumes are correct

16. ensure that the aws command is there

17. ensure that conf file is correct

18. Reimplement the mount function to use <sys/mount.h> library (done)
19. ensure idele volumes are mounted at the begining of the program (done)
20. ensure target filesystem is mounted at the begining of the program (done)

21. start a cleaner thread that check if volumes are correct
22. TODO: ensure that the aws command is there
23. currenlty, Volumes class reads from diskinfo file direcoty, make it read from an array
