1. Rename the Disks Class to Volume and investigate whether you need it to be a class or namespace (Done. Made it as class)
2. Merge the Dispatcher with the manager
2. Add 'release' and 'quire' functions
3. Modify Logger class to accept localhost_name, program_name in the constructor to avoid typing these everytime
4. Put the parse_args function in utilities
5. redo the configuration load to a better way to avoid writing it more than one time
6. Removing the syncing from inside the sync.cpp file and put it in a separate file
7. Move the syncing funtionality to Disks(Volumes Class)
8. I fixed the disatcher pars_args function, do this for client, manager, synchroziner
9. use dynamic array to avoid segment fault in manager, disk, dispatcher
10. When installing the machine on a new machine, make sure that the installer creates the direcotryes for TempMountPoint VolumeFilePath SnapshotFile *LogFile. All of these varibles etcist on the erc/config file.
11. make sure that the client progra adds an entry in the /etc/fstab for the mounted disk
12. Create a sync class so it can be used by dispatcher and synchroziner and Volumes class
13. have snapshots class to use unix time rather than actual time. Also, store data in unix time
