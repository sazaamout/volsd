Volumes
- Add 'release' and 'quire' functions and remove it from dispatcher and dont forget to use locks when using write_to_file function
- Move the syncing funtionality to Volumes Class (think about it)
- adds an entry in the /etc/fstab for the mounted disk
- currenlty, Volumes class reads from diskinfo file direcoty, make it read from an array
- use dynamic array to avoid segment fault in manager, disk, dispatcher (Done, need testing)

utility
- Put the parse_args function in utilities
- redo the configuration load to a better way to avoid writing it more than one time
- ensure that conf file is correct


dispatcher
- ensure that the aws command is there
- fixed the disatcher pars_args function (done for dispatcher. Still needed for sync and client)



sync
- Removing the syncing from inside the sync.cpp file and put it in a separate file (think about it)


General 
- When installing the machine on a new machine, make sure that the installer creates the direcotryes for TempMountPoint VolumeFilePath SnapshotFile *LogFile. All of these varibles etcist on the erc/config file. (done, need test)
- Create a sync class so it can be used by dispatcher and synchroziner and Volumes class
- start a cleaner thread that check if volumes are correct


Logger
- remove '2017' from logger
- Modify Logger class to accept localhost_name, program_name in the constructor to avoid typing these everytime


DONE:
- Reimplement the mount function to use <sys/mount.h> library (done)
- ensure idele volumes are mounted at the begining of the program (done)
- ensure target filesystem is mounted at the begining of the program (done)
- Rename the Disks Class to Volume and investigate whether you need it to be a class or namespace (Done. Made it as class)
- Merge the Dispatcher with the manager (done)
- have snapshots class to use unix time rather than actual time. Also, store data in unix time (done)
- mount/ensure the target file system (done)
